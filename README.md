# ME-WildySlayer
RS3 MemoryError script for Wilderness slayer tasks (**Utilizes Max Guild**)

## Things to know:
```lua
local food = "Shark"

local function NecroBloodPreset() --necro loadout with 2 blood runes 2 law runes for Annakarl Teleport, Super prayer renewal potion (not really needed) and a wildy sword

local function NecromancyBonePrayerPreset() -- necro loadout with dragontooth necklace and bonecrusher

```
- if you want to remove the usage of the prayer renewal (**kalgerion task and abyss lords use prayer renewal**)
```lua
--search for this
function PrayerCheck()
```
### Ability bar (for teleports and prayer):
#### Everything in this screenshot has to be in the ability bar (with the exception of the prayer renewal if you wish not to use it)
